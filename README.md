# IronTrack

This is my first Mobile App! Written in Swift and using Apple's new framework SwiftUI, I challenged myself to self learn the language through the process of creating this project. IronTrack is a free to download app on the iOS App Store that allows you track and log your workouts. Using your previously inputed data, the algorith will create customized goals for you to optimize your progression and training. Additionally, a recently added feature allows users to visually see their progress through the Feed Tab where they can see daily, weekly, and monthly charts record their work, weightm, sets and reps. Coupled with sample exercises and lifts with detailed images and instructions, this app can be both a helpful start for beginners and a useful tool for experienced lifters as well.
