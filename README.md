# IronTrack

Written in Swift and using Apple's new framework SwiftUI, IronTrack is a free to download app on the iOS App Store that allows users to track and log their workouts with ease. Using previously inputed data, the algorithm will create customized goals for users to optimize their progression and training. Additionally, a recently added feature allows users to visually see their progress through the Feed Tab where they can see daily, weekly, and monthly charts that record their total work, weight, sets and reps. Coupled with sample exercises and lifts with detailed images and instructions, this app can be both a helpful start for beginners and a useful tool for experienced lifters as well.
